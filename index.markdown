## What is Mlem?
Mlem is a client for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org), a Reddit-esque, open-source link aggregator. With Mlem, you can effortlessly participate in the conversation across all Lemmy servers. 

## Why Use Mlem?
Mlem is the first native SwiftUI Lemmy client on the AppStore. It feels right at home on your 
iPhone (and soon iPad and Mac). With tons of options for customizing your your experience.
